		<h2 id="cs">Computer Science (CS)</h2>
			<p>The Computer Science (CS) major at the University of California, Irvine is a broad curriculum that allows students to explore different topics in modern computing. This major focuses on software development—specifically the execution aspect, during which software applications are built and tested with the use of programming languages and tools. The focus on software components of computers makes this major suitable for those who wish to learn more about the underlying concepts found in the systems that operate on physical machines and devices.</p>
			<p>Computer Science emphasizes the application of computing theory, which involves mathematical algorithm analysis and rigorous individual programming in order to develop the students’ problem-solving skills. Through methods of analysis and application of computing logic, students may create projects concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI), the optimization of computer graphics, and the development of network security. Due to the focus on programming systems, Computer Science students are expected to learn multiple programming languages, including—but not limited to—Java, Python, and C++, which are used in their courses and commonly used in technology companies.</p>

		<h2 id="cse">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</h2>
			<p>The Computer Science and Engineering major at UCI offers student with a unique perspective on computing that teaches them both the hardware and software aspects of computers. The CSE major will teach you both hardware engineering and software engineering aspects of computing, giving you an overall sense of how to create computer systems and program computer software. This major essentially gives you a combined experience of both computer science and computer engineering.</p>
			<p>In the CSE major you will be required to take casework which will teach you about computer programming, computer hardware and architecture, software engineering, science elective courses, math, and computer engineering courses. You will learn how to design hardware and software systems along with learning about algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, computer graphics, and electrical engineering. The CSE major provides you with a great understanding of how computer systems work, interact, and operate from both a hardware and software level.</p>
			<p>A degree in Computer Science and Engineering will provide you with job opportunities in building hardware infrastructure, embedded devices, operating systems, and networking software. Some careers that will be available to you as a CSE major will include traffic management, flight control, earthquake monitoring, automotive control and building smart homes. Companies that a CSE major could expect to work for would be Intel, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, IBM and many others. If you are interested in both hardware and software aspects of computers then Computer Science and Engineering is the major for you.</p>

		<h2 id="inf">Informatics (IN4MATIX/INF)</h2>
			<p>The informatics majors’ underlying theme is the relationship and interactions between a computer system and its context. The informatics course topics range from project management and requirements elicitation, software implementation and design, and exploration of alternative solutions. Informatics is provides “a multidisciplinary perspective that includes computer science, information science, organizational science, social science, and cognitive science.”[uc Irvine general catalogue] The informatics major at University of California, Irvine provides two areas of specialization: human-computer interaction and organizations and information technology.</p>
			<p>The Informatics major at the University of California, Irvine provides students with a technical background while preparing students for a career in a broad spectrum of fields. the human-computer interaction specialization prepares students to enter the workforce as an Interaction Designer, Usability Engineer, and Software Engineer. The course work for the organizations and information technology specialization prepares students for careers as a Project Manager, System Analyst, and Software Engineer. Students who earn a B.S. in Informatics are not limited to these career options and have the ability to be versatile in the workforce.</p>
			<a href="#">[Back to Top]</a>
			
		<h2 id="se">Software Engineering (SE)</h2>
			<p>Software engineering focuses on preparing students to enter the workforce and effectively integrate into a software engineering team. The software engineering major provides students with a strong technical background while touching on mathematics. The coursework provides students with tools and techniques to think outside of the box when creating large software systems. The software engineering major at University of California, Irvine “emphasizes the design and implementation or large software systems.”</p>
			<p>The Software Engineering major at the University of California, Irvine prepares students for a career in the technical field. Students may pursue careers as a Web and Mobile Application Developer, Software Engineer, Systems Architect, Project Manager, or Game Designer.
