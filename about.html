		<p><strong>Meet the Fab 5!</strong> We are currently (2014) upper-division students of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), and we have seen fellow students change majors within the school, realizing that their initial major does not actual suit them. Unfortunately, this occurs primarily because the ICS website does not contain explicit, detailed information that would help students determine the perfect match. </p>
		<p>We don’t like seeing others groan about being uninterested in their major, so we want people to choose the right major once they enroll in the school. This is why we decided to suggest an ICS major to you, depending on your personality and interests. As students of the ICS school, we are familiar with the topics presented in the school’s majors. But don’t worry! We also did our research about each major, consulting the Student Affairs Office and fellow students for details not available on the ICS website.</p>
		<p>We hope that our website helps you choose the right major the first time!</p>
